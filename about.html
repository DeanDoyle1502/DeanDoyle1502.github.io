        <div class="image-item">
            <p>My own personal background in the music industry in Ireland led me to decide to build this solution for working musicians. 
            I started out playing with bands about 15 years ago, at this stage of my career I would play with one band at a time and was sufficiently busy. 
            After a few years of this I decided to make it more of a full-time job and it was at this point I realised that working with one act would not supply enough work to sustain a full-time job as a sole trader. 
            Through the years up to this point I had built up a good network of venues with which I had a good relationship with and therefore noticed I had the opportunity for more work but not enough availability of the other musicians in the single band I was in to fill these gigs. 
            This led to a loss of revenue as I was having to turn down gig offers from venues. 
            This in turn led me to try becoming more flexible and able to stand in with any acts that needed someone to fill in for a gig, this combined with my connections with the venues allowed me to book acts and insert myself into them as an extra member with no added work to the current act as I would learn their material. 
            This benefited the acts as they were getting more work, and it benefited me as I had more available musicians to choose from to fill any gigs I was being offered.</p>
