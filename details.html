        <h2>User Overviews</h2>
        <p>The application I propose to create as a solution to the issue will focus on consolidating the fragmented way these interactions between musicians in the industry are already taking place. Users will be able to create profiles and from these fit into two categories: <strong>“Looking for Musician”</strong> and <strong>“Looking for Gig”</strong> at a base level.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking for Musician:</h3>
        <p>This represents a user who may be part of an existing act and is in need of a musician to fill in a position for an upcoming gig. This user will be able to create a profile on the app and put up a gig opportunity post. The user will fill in some information about the gig such as the location and date and then also what position is needed to be filled. This will then be posted and made available for application by users who are in the <strong>“Looking for Gig”</strong> category.</p>
        <p>When an application is made by a musician, a connection is made between the gig poster and the musician looking for work where further discussion can take place. In the scenario where the gig is accepted, the gig is logged as “accepted” and after the date stated on the listing, the user that posted the gig is prompted to give the user who accepted the gig a rating based on some previously outlined criteria such as <strong>“musicianship”, “punctuality”, and “quality of gear”</strong>. These ratings then help the user who took the gig to get further work.</p>

        <h3>Looking for Gig:</h3>
        <p>This represents a user who is possibly not part of an act and is available for work. This user will set up a profile containing basic information alongside what instrument they play and any more relevant information. The user will be able to set their availability and also the range/area they are willing to travel for a gig.</p>
        <p>When a gig is posted that is in their range of travel, matches their instrument, and is on a date in which they are set as available, the user will get a notification prompting them about the details of the gig. If the user feels like they would like to accept the gig, they are then connected with the user that posted it. After discussion has taken place, and if they decide to take the gig, it is added to their calendar. After the date proposed by the gig listing, they will receive a rating from the user who listed the job.</p>
